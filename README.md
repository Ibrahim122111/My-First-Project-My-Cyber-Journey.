# My-First-Project-My-Cyber-Journey.
This is the place where I saved what I learned in my course.

## Lab Notes_ Day-1
Today I learned how I open GitHub account, and how I create repository.

# During My Favorite Course (OSINT) Open Source Intelligence.
 Last lecture about Metadata, something about it is we enjoyed and learned a lot, for tracking social media accounts and track real picture Data isn't easy but we'll happy.

# Beyond metadata.
 I'm exploring Google Dorking via the GHDB and DorkGPT to understand how misconfigured servers leak sensitive data. Mastering reconnaissance is the first step in a successful forensic investigation.

I am learning to use the Google Hacking Database (GHDB) to identify misconfigured IoT devices and exposed web servers. This highlights the importance of proper credential management and network security to prevent unauthorized data exposure.

## Reconnaissance & OSINT Skills.
- **Google Dorking**: Familiar with using advanced search operators (Dorks) via the Google Hacking Database (GHDB).
- **Automation Tools**: Experienced in using **DorkGPT** to generate precise queries for identifying misconfigured servers and exposed IoT devices.
- **Ethical Analysis**: Understanding the security risks of exposed webcams and databases to help organizations improve their network security.
